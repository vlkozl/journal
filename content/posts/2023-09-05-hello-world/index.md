üí° So, with just one pushed commit this site is now on-line. But again an internal critic asks me:
> *"But why? Why the hell to create another new blog? There are plenty of bloggers and MVPs around with all sorts of wise thoughts, projects and cool stories."* 

Of course there are lots of smart people in NAV/BC community sharing their experiences ~~and/or promoting something~~. Nevertheless, I truly believe that the topic of Dynamics NAV / BC application development is so vast and rich that so many involved people could share their experience endlessly. However, there are major problems there applied to all participants ‚Äî both pros in bigtech or juniors from end-user side.

üöÄ The *speed* of new feature releases, new business solutions implemented even in the standard "Cronus" from Microsoft exceeds any practical possibility to learn it all in detail. While getting experience in one thing, several new things will appear on top of it. Knowledge becomes fragmented. When I've been at Microsoft, I could have an option to look back into an object change history up to 6 years, but this could not tell me a story on its behavior or features it was expressing or connected to. When you're on Partner / Customer side, you either use your colleague's solutions and experience, or looking for solutions on community: forums, blogs, etc. Either way, one of the really working options is to communicate with others.

ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è With modern release cycle our knowledge becoming obsolete much rapidly. Back in pre-BC times, when you have experience coding for NAV 4.0 you could successfully code for NAV 2009. But nowadays with BC14 or BC15 experience only you cannot use all the features of BC23. You need some time to learn and adopt them for your project. Learning hubs, like the one from Microsoft, do a great job but still pretty limited - especially when you're looking for a specific solution, or some feature description from a previous version.

‚è≥ From my experience, most of software engineers have very limited amount of time to learn new features; therefore they get experience from practice first by building them. Which can take some extra time because technology or solution is new. However, if there are useful helpful pages exist on the topic in community, this helps a lot and speed-up the process.

üëØ In my opinion, **collaboration** is what greatly helps with all of those problems. In the modern world it *should* be considered as a normal way of learning new things, besides to search or prompting skills. Contributing to community could also be taken as an essential part of it. To start, it is not necessary to jump high and make any high demands on yourself. The main thing is to be consistent and patient, choose topics and write about you feel confident in a way that would be interesting to others. And this is exactly what I'm planning to do in this journal.
