Dynamics NAV or Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central is a well known ERP business application that is hugely popular among the small and mid sized companies. And this is where I usually come, at some point, as a Software Engineer, to help it grow  business, to improve their processes, implement features that make things run more efficiently and smoothly. So that I become completely depend on this business being successful for some time.

But with that, I should never forget that business is a quite specific type of activity. All businesses are different and run in specific environmental conditions, where so many things could change over time: market laws, owners, stakeholders, management, directors, markets, committees, budgets, leaders and priorities. Relationships and partnerships, trade agreements. People that carry too much responsibility, can suddenly get sick and pass away, or even get jailed. And social news feeds almost never tell you much this real stories about it, if not hyped for some reason.

Because I'm from Russia, I've seen some things in my life. My first job related to Navision was in a company that in 1,5 years went from prosperous to bankruptcy -- just because in 2000's it was really popular case to hijack a successful business. Founder and general director was released from jail only after his business was completely sold between competitors for 10% of its market value.
Some other companies I knew did regular payments to so-called "security" organizations to keep their business running without disturbance and extra checks for, for example, fire or emergency authority compliance. It was more rare case lately, but still exists in my homeland. 
In another company where I worked back in Moscow in the 2000s, I was warned in advance not to come to the office, because the special forces of the tax police were planning to storm it.
Long after that I've seen how many international big-tech companies can hire thousands from all over the world, unnaturally heating up the wage market, moving thousands of people across continents and countries. And at the same time they can laid off thousands of highly skilled employees in one week thus making these job markets too overloaded with workers, leaving people with very limited employment options and severely damaged motivation.

This is why I never ever considered myself as an indefinite, unreplaceable employee that settles-in, but never goes-out: too many things can change out there. Risks sticking to just one employer are too high, because of the nature of the business itself. Flexibility brings more dynamics, and more reliability here, as well as to companies.
So the best lesson I learned early - is to invest into my professional skills, flexibility, communications and networking. And this is not an easiest set to combine, given my purely engineering degree, you can trust me.

Today I've got the news that my employer does not need my services. Just because of the decision to upgrade into another technology instead of BC. Things like this just happens, and this is normal.

I learned many news things here and was able to deliver many great features too which I never thought before. And I'm hugely thankful for this opportunity. Despite the outdated NAV version, I was still able to use modern tech. stack and even play around GitHub and GitHub Copilot. And I'm happy to say I was surrounded by professional managers and experts and it was a pleasure working with all of them together. What I'm especially proud of is that I've helped to open BC technology doors for a wonderful student that can for sure take Junior developer position very soon.
Thank you, Statista BI&FO team, for great team spirit, great opportunity to build ever lasting solutions based on modern technology, and a chance to be your reliable asset.
