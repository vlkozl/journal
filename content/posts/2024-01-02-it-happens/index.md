### About my work
Microsoft Dynamics NAV or Dynamics 365 Business Central is super popular ERP from small to some large companies around the globe. My role as a Software Engineer comes into play precisely in this domain, where I contribute to help business grow, to improve internal processes, implement features that enhance operational efficiency.

I sell my time and fully depend on this business being successful for some time. But with that, I should never forget that all businesses are different and run in its unique environmental conditions, where so many variables could shuffle over the time: market laws, owners, stakeholders, management, directors, markets, committees, budgets, leaders and priorities, relationships and partnerships, trade agreements - so many factors can affect its pace and efficiency. People that carry too much responsibility, can suddenly get sick and pass away, or even get jailed. Job markets can be dry finding demanded experts.

Life can throw some curveballs too. Because I'm from Russia, I've seen some wild things in my life. My first job related to Navision was in a company that went from being a successful distribution network to flat-out bankrupt in just 1,5 years — just because in 2000's it was common case to hijack a successful business. Founder and general director found himself incarcerated, only regaining freedom after his business had been sold off to competitors for a mere 10% of its market value.

Some other companies I knew did regular payments to so-called "security" organizations to keep their business running without disturbance and avoid additional checks, such as fire or emergency authority compliance. While this practice has become less common recently, it still exists in my homeland.

In a different company where I worked in Moscow back in the 2000s, I was warned in advance not to come to the office, because of the tax police special forces were planning to storm it on the same day.

Years later, I observed how international big-tech companies could hire thousands from all over the world, unnaturally heating up wage and rent markets, relocating thousands of people across countries and continents. Simultaneously, they could laid off thousands of highly skilled employees in a single week, making these markets overloaded, leaving people with very limited employment options and severely damaged motivation.

> This is why I never ever considered myself as an indefinite, unreplaceable employee that settles-in, but never leaves: too many things can change out there. Risks sticking to just one employer are too high, because of the nature of the business itself. Flexibility, on the other hand, brings more dynamics but also more reliable.

So, the best lesson I learned early on is to invest in my professional skills, flexibility, communications and networking, and use any opportunity to learn and improve. This is not an easiest set to combine and a task to do, given my purely engineering degree, you can trust me on that. A lot of things didn't come from old professors and young PhDs, but rather practical experience and mistakes.

### The News
Today I've got the news that my employer does not need my services in the foreseeable future. This decision was made because the management chose to upgrade ERP to another technology instead of BC, probably SAP or F&O. Things like this just happens. And I consider this as *normal*.

I've learned many news things here at Statista and have been able to deliver many great features  I never touched before. AzureFunctions, API integrations, OpenAPI formats, PowerShell remoting, GitHub integrations, and some others. And I'm hugely thankful for this opportunity. Despite that NAV version of 11.0 isn't much up-to date, I was still able to use modern tech stack and even play around hyped GitHub Copilot.

And I'm genuinely happy to say I was surrounded by professional managers and experts and it was a pleasure working with all of them. I learned a lot from their expertise.

What I'm especially proud of — is that I've helped to open BC technology doors for a wonderful student that can undoubtedly take Junior Developer position very soon.

> Thank you, Statista BI&FO team, for the great team spirit, opportunity to build ever lasting modern solutions, and a chance to be your reliable asset.

New project is definitely looking for me now, and I'm eagerly looking for it too.

### Quick summary
 - Never rely solely only on one employer. be flexible.
 - Even the best employers can change their plans 180 degrees, affecting yours.
 - Good or bad relationships in your team are not necessarily connected to business decisions.
