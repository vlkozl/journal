My name is Vladimir and I work with [**Navision** / **Dynamics NAV** / **Business Central**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Dynamics_365#Microsoft_Dynamics_365_Business_Central) for the last 16 years as a Software Engineer. During this time I have seen and did a lot of everything related to it. Check out my formal bio [here](/journal/bio).

Software Engineeing is full of fragments: ideas, know-hows, snippets, tricks and tips that we use and need a lot. In big-techs such as Microsoft, you rely on your numerous colleagues, their extensive expertise and huge code base. In the rest of the world you don't have such priveleges and rely on your knowledge or professional community.

I started this journal in 2023 inspired by **[BC TechDays 2023](https://www.bctechdays.com/)** conference to make my humble contribution to the community â€” and I encourage everyone else to do the same. This journal is about both technical and non-technical topics. For both professional and hobby engineering or related to it.
