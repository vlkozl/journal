Born in 1981 in Moscow, Russia. Graduated from Moscow Institute of Radio Technics, Electronics and Automatics [(MIREA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIREA_%E2%80%93_Russian_Technological_University) in 2004 with specialization in "Robots and Robotics Systems".

After graduation there was no profile work around, so since 2007 I started working with ERP systems of Navision Attain, Microsoft Dynamics NAV / [Dynamics 365 Business Central](http://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/business-central/overview/) as a developer, occasionally combining with project management roles.

Since then I worked on both sides of ERP world: on clients using the system for their business needs, and on partner (vendor) side implementing the system to clients and various solutions based on it.

At 2016 I've been recruited to Microsoft Development Center Russia into App Sustain Engineering (AppSE) team where I participated in the development and improvement of the system, its support and troubleshooting of problems arising from partners and clients from all over the world. We supported all localizations for all officially supported versions by fixing bugs and collaborating on some specific requests. We were the team, who made the most of bugfixing in AL and our changes were released monthly within Cumulative Updates.

Since February 2020 I live in Munich, Germany, still working with the same product for local customer companies, using ERP in their businesses.
